# Introduction

My configuration is your run of the mill dot file, I just pile everything into
it while trying to keep it tidy and relatively fast. 

This is an eternal work in progress, as is Emacs. 

## Miscellaneous

A lot of good ideas from my configuration come from helpful users
with excellent initialization files, one can look at : 

- [Prot's dotemacs](https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/)

- [Steve Purcell's init file](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)

- [The using Emacs blog](https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/)

- [Jamie Collinson's init file](https://jamiecollinson.com/blog/my-emacs-config/)
